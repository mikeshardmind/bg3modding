# Balance context

All changes here are done with the intent of use within the context of a
more comprehensive set of overhauls that increase game difficulty.
These changes are not done to make the game easier again.

All playtesting will be done in an environment intended to be more difficult
than a non-single save honor mode run.

The goal is for all changes to make the game and character progression
specifically feel nicer without making any strategy become a new outlier,
in either direction, strong or weak.

Many changes may move existing strategies more toward the norm.

Strategies that are specifically exploits (ie. vendor scams) may be invalidated without
the same level of consideration.

It is okay if different strategies peak at different content levels.

# Compatability and mid playthrough modlist changes.

It is intended that all changes are as minimally invasive and as compatible as
reasonably possible.

Mods that alter static data may be tricky to remove mid-playthrough.

While all mods here are safe to add midplaythrough,
some progressions may end up in an inconsistent state.

In both cases, respeccing to a level 1 class not modified by adding/removing
before hand should avoid most issues.
