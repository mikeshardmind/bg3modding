# Some Bg3 mods and tweaks

Mod Permissions/Licensing:

To the extent not restricted by other existing rightsholders, all work here is
given freely for the use of others.

Currently, no assets are licensed seperately.
This may change if any art is added, and will be noted as it applies, but I will not add
any art that will require the mods not be allowed to be reshared relatively unrestricted.

If a statement of gift to the public is insufficient and
you require a license for any portion of work which is not creative assets covered above
and is also not content covered by
[Larian Studio's Fan content terms](https://baldursgate3.game/bg3-fan-content-terms/)
You may assume your choice of any of the following licenses:

- [0BSD](https://spdx.org/licenses/0BSD.html)
- [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html)
- [WTFPL](https://spdx.org/licenses/WTFPL.html)


If you like any of what I'm rebalancing/tweaking enough that you're wanting to donate,
please give to either a charity[^1], or to the original authors whose work
I am adjusting further with more mods.

The main branch will be used for development, specific releases will be tagged.
Tweaks here will be structured across mods in a way that you can easily pick and
choose which rebalancing choices of mine you agree with for your own use and use
only those.


## WitchKnightTweaks

This is just some balance changes to
[Lumaterian's Witch Knight subclass mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/7984)
that are made with limitations of the vanilla game's implementation of warlock spell slots.

### Changes

- Sanguine Offering Charges are 1 per Witch knight level,
  matching [source material](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M0i_wbRAX8qAz1OIjbF).
- Lv 3: Gain pact weapon bind/summon abilities.
- Lv 3: Gain agonizing blast
- lv 5 (only if you also have the Invocations expanded mod): Gain improved pact weapon.

### Rationale

Because of the base game's implementation of warlock spell slots,
both Witch knight and Warlock are punished if you multiclass these two together.

The primary reason for this multiclass would be for invocations and increased
warlock spell slot levels, And this multiclass is also the primary reason
to play witch knight over eldritch knight.

This mod does not attempt to prevent you from multiclassing with warlock after having it,
but doing so will only weaken the build again due to base game implementation.

This leaves the Witch Knight closer to existing as if it's tabletop counterpart
had been multiclassed with hexblade but a little weaker, as it only gains 1 invocation
(pre 2024 pacts as invocations) and no increased spell slot advancement.

### Compatability

Unknown at this time.
