Mod Permissions/Licensing:

To the extent not restricted by other existing rightsholders, all work here is
given freely for the use of others.

Currently, no assets are licensed seperately.
This may change if any art is added, and will be noted as it applies, but I will not add
any art that will require the mods not be allowed to be reshared relatively unrestricted.

If a statement of gift to the public is insufficient and
you require a license for any portion of work which is not creative assets covered above
and is also not content covered by
[Larian Studio's Fan content terms](https://baldursgate3.game/bg3-fan-content-terms/)
You may assume your choice of any of the following licenses:

- [0BSD](https://spdx.org/licenses/0BSD.html)

- [WTFPL](https://spdx.org/licenses/WTFPL.html)


If you like any of what I'm rebalancing/tweaking enough that you're wanting to donate,
please give to either a charity[^1], or to the original authors whose work
I am adjusting further with more mods.

The main branch will be used for development, specific releases will be tagged.
Tweaks here will be structured across mods in a way that you can easily pick and
choose which rebalancing choices of mine you agree with for your own use and use
only those.

# Balance context

All changes here are done with the intent of use within the context of a
more comprehensive set of overhauls that increase game difficulty.
These changes are not done to make the game easier again.

All playtesting will be done in an environment intended to be more difficult
than a non-single save honor mode run.

The goal is for all changes to make the game and character progression
specifically feel nicer without making any strategy become a new outlier,
in either direction, strong or weak.

Many changes may move existing strategies more toward the norm.

Strategies that are specifically exploits (ie. vendor scams) may be invalidated without
the same level of consideration.

It is okay if different strategies peak at different content levels.

## WitchKnightTweaks

This is just some balance changes to
[Lumaterian's Witch Knight subclass mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/7984)
that are made with limitations of the vanilla game's implementation of warlock spell slots,
and with the intent of better matching existing design principles in bg3

### Changes

- Sanguine Offering Charges are 1 per Witch knight level,
  matching [source material](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M0i_wbRAX8qAz1OIjbF).
- Lv 3: Gain pact weapon bind/summon abilities.
- Lv 3: Gain a warlock invocation
- lv 5: Gain a warlock invocation, Increase Sanguine Offering charges usable per turn by 1
- lv 7: Gain a warlock invocation
- lv 9: Gain a warlock invocation
- lv 11: Increase Sanguine Offering charges usable per turn by 1

Note that any invocations that rely on warlock level, including those added by other mods,
will not treat witch knight levels as warlock levels, as they are not.

### Rationale

Because of the base game's implementation of warlock spell slots,
both Witch knight and Warlock are punished if you multiclass these two together.

The primary reason for this multiclass would be for invocations and increased
warlock spell slot levels, And this multiclass is also the primary reason
to play witch knight over eldritch knight.

This mod does not attempt to prevent you from multiclassing with warlock after having it,
but doing so will only weaken the build again due to base game implementation.

This leaves the Witch Knight closer to existing as if it's tabletop counterpart
had been multiclassed with hexblade but a little weaker
(in theory, the changes still need playtesting)

### Compatability

This replaces the subclass progression for all odd levels of witch knight.
No other modifications are
