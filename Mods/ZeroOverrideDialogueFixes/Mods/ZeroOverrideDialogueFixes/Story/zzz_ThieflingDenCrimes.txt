// There's multiple bugs with these, some in dialogue files, some in script files.

// Just disable all of the "crimes" that the thieflings delude themselves into reporting.
// The tresspassing one in particular isn't handled well in vanilla, as it's reported per character,
// and can't be resolved for the whole active party at once,
// resulting in what *looks* like an infinite dialog loop getting stopped by guards in some cases.

// Leave the normal crimes like murder detected, just disable all the ways mol wants to report you
// just for knowing the theives exist
