- Cantrips should be a viable damage option at all levels
  - This reduces having spellcasters = long rests become triple needed
  - This increases the value of crowd control spells relative to
    damage spells of the same level
- Leveled spells do **not** need to outdamage cantrips if they provide utility.
- Healing spells **should** be weaker than damaging spells of the same level.
- Concentration should be avoided as a requirement on damage spells unless they
  provide an ongoing *area/surface* effect.
- Concentration should be required for most CC and area control spells.
- Spell durations should not be variable based on the level of a cast.
- Not all spell lists are created equal. Access to various things should remain
  thematic and appropriate to class features available.
- The rebalance will assume a curated inclusion of specific spell mods for
  impact on spell lists.
