- Cantrips should be a viable damage option at all levels
  - This reduces having spellcasters = long rests become triple needed
  - This increases the value of crowd control spells relative to
    damage spells of the same level
- Leveled spells do **not** need to outdamage cantrips if they provide utility.
- Healing spells **should** be weaker than damaging spells of the same level.
- Concentration should be avoided as a requirement on damage spells unless they
  provide an ongoing *area/surface* effect.
- Concentration should be required for most CC and area control spells.
- Spell durations should not be variable based on the level of a cast.
- Not all spell lists are created equal. Access to various things should remain
  thematic and appropriate to class features available.
- The rebalance will assume a curated inclusion of specific spell mods for
  impact on spell lists. It will make attempts to not break any other use,
  but balance will not be focused around spell mods I don't personally use.
- Spells should assume the potential to scale to level 20

## Damage values

### Non-weapon Cantrips:

Most Cantrips have been changed across the board.

Damage values all include a flat +2 bonus.
Dice scale based on level and a chosen base dice size

This progression is a simple modification based on a heroic fantasy
homebrew table's play that I enjoyed, but has been toned down just a tad
for the first few levels, as martials will not have the +1 weapons
that table had at level 1.

The core idea here is that a cantrip should always deal at least 3
damage when succesful, ensuring no successes are largely unimpactful in combat.

- lv 1-4: 1d(N-2)+2 for all dice other than d4, which remain a d4
- lv 5-9: 2dN+2
- lv 10-13: 3dN+2
- lv 14+: 4dN+2

### Cantrips that make weapon attacks as part of the magic action:

Scaling at levels 5, 11, and 17

These scale differently because they also make weapon attacks, should fit
best on a gish/spellblade archetype, and should not become the default cantrip
for other build archetypes.

Values vary by weapon cantrip

Extra Attack interactions are *not* fixed with this. It is **highly** reccomended to use
[Extra Attack Fix SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5475) for this.


### Leveled spells

I do not anticipate making as many changes to leveled spells.
The across the board cantrip changes are largely a systems issue with the
interactions between rests if using leveled spells,
dexterity stat dominance, and light crossbows existing.
Most casters were better off never using a cantrip for damage before level 6,
with some going further.

By contrast, the expected changes for leveled spells will be more surgical
rather than system addressing.
