- Cantrips should be a viable damage option at all levels
  - This reduces having spellcasters = long rests become triple needed
  - This increases the value of crowd control spells relative to
    damage spells of the same level
- Leveled spells do **not** need to outdamage cantrips if they provide utility.
- Healing spells **should** be weaker than damaging spells of the same level.
- Concentration should be avoided as a requirement on damage spells unless they
  provide an ongoing *area/surface* effect.
- Concentration should be required for most CC and area control spells.
- Spell durations should not be variable based on the level of a cast.
- Not all spell lists are created equal. Access to various things should remain
  thematic and appropriate to class features available.
- The rebalance will assume a curated inclusion of specific spell mods for
  impact on spell lists. It will make attempts to not break any other use,
  but balance will not be focused around spell mods I don't personally use.
- Spells should assume the potential to scale to level 20

### Intentionally unmodified

- Friends
- Guidance
- Light
- Minor illusion
- Resistence

### Needs deeper rework

- booming blade
- true strike
- Produce flame (maybe, has partial modification currently)

## Damage values

### Cantrips:

Cantrips have been changed across the board.

Damage values all include a flat +2 bonus.
Dice scale based on level and a chosen base dice size

This progression is a simple modification based on a heroic fantasy
homebrew table's play that I enjoyed, but has been toned down just a tad
for the first few levels, as martials will not have the +1 weapons
that table had at level 1.

The core idea here is that a cantrip should always deal at least 3
damage when succesful, ensuring no successes are largely unimpactful in combat.

lv 1-4: 1d(N-2)+2 for all dice other than d4, which remain a d4
lv 5-9: 2dN+2
lv 10-13: 3dN+2
lv 14+: 4dN+2
